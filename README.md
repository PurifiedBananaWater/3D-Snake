# 3D-Snake
 You're a snake that can travel in 3 dimensions but you can only see 2, also your food is only 2D so....


 How to play:
 It's your normal snake game using the arrow keys on your keyboard to move left, right, up, and down.
 However you use the W-key and the S-key to move in and out of the plane the snakes head is on.
 When the snake head is on the same plane as the food you can see the food.
 Each plane has it's own color.
 Just like normal snake if you run into the walls or yourself it's game over.
 Since there are only 9 planes, I made it so you don't run into a wall if you go to far, the 3rd dimension is borderless.
 In the 3rd dimension you can still run into your body if you're not careful.
 You can avoid running into your body if you hop onto another plane.
